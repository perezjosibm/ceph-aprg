\begin{abstract} 
In this report we describe the empirical results of investigating
the performance impact of the Manual versus Basic configurations for Crimson OSD
using RBD volumes for Bluestore.\\
        The report is structured as follows: we describe the hardware used and illustrate the
        general setup. Then we describe the preconditioning and prefill of the NVMe drives previous
        to execute the actual tests. We describe the benchmark FIO workloads and illustrate
        the general strategies of \textbf{Latency target} (in which FIO will attempt to find
            the max performance point that the given workload will run at while maintaining a
            latency below this target), and confiming this with longer \textbf{Response Latency curves}
        (in which gradually increase the IO load to a point where throughput flattens out
         or decreases whilst latency increases, hence an indication of a saturation point).
        We conclude the report with our analysis remarks and recommendations.
